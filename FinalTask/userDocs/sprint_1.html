<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Automated Car-Parking</h3>

A company intends to build an <i>automating parking service</i> composed of a set of elements:

<ul>
<li>A software system, named <em>ParkManagerService</em>, that implements the required automation functions.</li>
<li>A <tt>DDR</tt> robot working as a <em>transport trolley</em>, that is intially situated in its <em>home</em> location.
The <tt>transport trolley</tt> has the form of a square of side length <em>RD</em>.
</li>
<li>A <em>parking-area</em> is an empty room that includes;
	<ul>
	<li>an <em>INDOOR</em> to enter the car in the area. Facing the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, there is
	a <em>INDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>weigthsensor</em> that measures the <em>weigth</em> of the car;</li>
	<li>an <em>OUTDOOR</em> to exit from the <tt>parking-area</tt>. Just after the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt>, there is
	<em>OUTDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>outsonar</em>, used to detect the presence of a car.
	The <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>, once engaded by a car, should be freed within a prefixed interval of time <em>DTFREE</em>; </li>
	<li>a number <tt>N (N=6)</tt> of <em>parking-slots</em>;</li>
	<li>a <em>thermometer</em> that measures the temperature <em>TA</em> of the area;</li>
	<li>a <em>fan</em> that should be activated when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, where <em>TMAX</em> is a prefixed value (e.g. <tt>35</tt>)</li>
	</ul>
	A <em>map</em> of the parking area, represented as a grid of squares of side length <em>RD</em>,
	is available in the file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.issLabStart/userDocs/parkingMap.txt" target="code">parkingMap.txt</a>:
	<pre>
|r, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X,
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X,
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X,
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X,
|0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X,
|X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, </pre>
	The map includes the positions of the  <tt>parking-slots</tt> (marked above with the symbol <k>X</k>)
	and of the <em>fixed obstacles</em> in the area (the walls marked with the symbol <b>X</b>).
	<br/><br/>
	The area marked with <k>X</k> is a sort of 'equipped area' upon which the <tt>transport trolley</tt> cannot walk.
	Thus, to get the car in the <tt>parking-slot</tt> <ks>(2,2)</ks>, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> must
	go in cell <ks>(1,2)</ks>.
	<br/><br/>

	The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.issLabStart/userDocs/parkingAreaConfig.js" target="code">parkingAreaConfig.js</a>

	<center><img src="./img/parkingAreaZone.PNG" alt="parkingAreaZone.PNG" width="45%" height="32%"/></center>
</li>
<li>a <em>parking-manager</em> (an human being) which supervises the state of the <tt>parking-area</tt>
and handles critical situations<!-- by using a software system named <em>ParkMonitoringService</em> -->. </li>
</ul>

<div class="remark">
The job of our company is to design, build and deploy the  <em>ParkManagerService</em>.
</div>
<!-- and the <em>ParkMonitoringService</em>.-->
<h3 id="requirements_user_stories">User stories</h3>
As a <bc>client - parking phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use a <em>ParkServiceGUI</em> provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  to notify my interest in <i>entering</i>
my auto in the <tt>parking-area</tt> and to receive as answer the number <em>SLOTNUM</em> of a  free parking-slot  (<tt>1&lt;=SLOTNUM&lt;=6</tt>).
<tt>SLOTNUM<k>==0</k></tt> means that no free slot is available.</em>

</li>
<li>If <tt>SLOTNUM <k>>0</k></tt>, I move my car in front to the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, get out of the car and afterwards press a <em>CARENTER</em> button on the
<em>ParkServiceGUI</em>. Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> takes over my car and moves it from the <tt>INDOOR</tt>
to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>.
The <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> will show to me a receipt that includes a (unique) <em>TOKENID</em>,
to be used in the <i>car pick up</i> phase.</li>
</ul>

As a <bc>client - car pick up phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> to submit the request to pick up my car, by sending the <tt>TOKENID</tt> previously received. </li>
<li>Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt>  takes over my car and moves it from its <tt>parking-slot</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.</li>
<li>I move the car, so to free the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.
</li>
 </ul>

As a <bc>parking-manager</bc>:
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <em>ParkServiceStatusGUI</em>  provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>
to observe the <em>current state</em> of the <tt>parking area</tt>, including the value <tt>TA</tt> of the temperature,
the state of the <tt>fan</tt> and the state of the <tt>transport trolley</tt> (<k>idle, working or stopped</k>).</li>
<li>I intend to <em>stop</em> the <tt>transport trolley</tt> when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, activate the <tt>fan</tt> and
wait until <k>TA &lt; TMAX</k>. At this time, I stop the <tt>fan</tt> and resume the behavior of the <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
Hopefully, the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the fan</ks> could also be automated by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>,
while the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the transport trolley</ks> is always up to me.
</li>

<li>I expect that the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> sends to me an <em>alarm</em> if it detectes that the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>
has not been cleaned within the <tt>DTFREE</tt> interval of time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="requirements_requirements">Requirements </h3>

The <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  should create the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> (for the client)
and the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> (for the manager) and then perform the following tasks:

<ul>

<li><hr/>
<em>acceptIN</em>: accept the request of a client to park the car if there is at least one <tt>parking-slot</tt> available,
select a free slot identified with a unique <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.<br/>
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>,
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager).
If the <tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is already engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).
<br/>
  <li><em>informIN</em>: inform the client about the value of the <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.</li>
If  <k>SLOTNUM>0</k>:
  <ol>
   <li><em>moveToIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>INDOOR</tt> ;</li>
  <li><em>receipt</em>: send to the client a receipt including the value of the <tt>TOKENID</tt> ;</li>
  <li><em>moveToSlotIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>;</li>
  <!-- <li>accept another request (<tt>acceptIN</tt> or <tt>acceptOUT</tt>). -->
  <li><em>backToHome</em>: if no other request is present,  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location,
  else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em>.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
If <k>SLOTNUM==0</k>:
	<ul>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if not already at home, move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><hr/>
<em>acceptOUT</em>: accept the request of a client to get out the car with <tt>TOKENID</tt>.
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager).
If the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is still engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).

	<ol>
	<li><em>findSlot</em>: deduce the number of the parking slot (<em>CARSLOTNUM</em>) from the <tt>TOKENID</tt>;</li>
	<li><em>moveToSlotOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>CARSLOTNUM/parking-slot</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if no other request is present  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location; <br/>
	else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em></li>

	</ol>
</li>
<li>
<hr/>
<em>monitor</em>: update the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> with the required information about the state of the system.
</li>

<li>
<hr/>
<em>manage</em>: accept the request of the manager to stop/resume the behavior of the  <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
</li>

</ul>
<h4>About the devices</h4>
All the sensors (<tt>weigthsensor</tt>, <tt>outsonar</tt>, <tt>thermometer</tt> ) and the <tt>fan</tt> should be properly simulated
by mock-objects or mock-actors.

<h4>When available a Raspberry and a sonar</h4>
The <tt>outsonar</tt> could be a real device. We can simulate the presence/absence of a car.

<h3>Non functional requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>The ideal work team is composed of <bc>3 persons</bc>. Teams of 1 or 2 persons (<bc>NOT</bc> 4 or more) are also allowed. </li>
<li>The team must present a <bc>workplan</bc> as the result of the requirement/problem analysis,
including some significant <bc>TestPlan</bc>.</li>
<li>The team must present the sequence of <bc>SPRINT</bc> performed, with appropriate motivations.</li>
<li>Each <bc>SPRINT</bc> must be associated with its own 'chronicle' (see <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.issLabStart/userDocs/templateToFill.html" target="lab">templateToFill.html</a>)
that presents, in concise way, the key-points related to each phases of development.<br/>
Hopefully, the team could also deploy the system using docker.</li>
<li>Each team must publish and maintain a GIT-repository (referred in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.issLabStart/userDocs/templateToFill.html" target="lab">templateToFill.html</a>)
with the code and the related documents.</li>

<li>The team must present (in synthetic, schematic way) the <bc>specific activity of each team-component</bc>.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Problem analysis</h2>
<div class="remark">
<h3>Relevant aspects</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The system to be built will be a distributed system, consisting of several macro-components:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the transport trolley (and its virtual environment);</li>
        <li>the weight sensor;</li>
        <li>the thermometer;</li>
        <li>the fan;</li>
        <li>the outsonar;</li>
        <li>our application (ParkManagerService), which sends commands to the trolley in order to meet the requirements.</li>
    </ul>
	<li>This distributed system, made of several heterogeneous components, would benefit greatly from an <k>actor-based</k> framework with support for <k>message-passing</k> interaction; for this purpose, we should leverage the avaliable <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.qakactor/userDocs/LabQakIntro2021.html#qakoverview">QAK meta-model</a> to build executable models; each logical component should be modeled as an actor;</li>
	<li>Since the available map measures the <kc>parking-area</kc> in squares of side length <ks>RD</ks> (same as trolley size), the communication with the virtual robot should follow the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.boundaryWalk/userDocs/BoundaryWalk.html#aril">aril convention</a>;</li>
	<li>PROTOCOLLI</li>
	<li>ABSTRACTION GAP</li>
	<li>EVIDENZIARE FUNZIONAMENTI PROATTIVI E REATTIVI</li>
</ol>
<center><img src="./img/actors.png" width="500px"></center>

<h3>Logical architecture</h3>

<h4>Presence sensors</h4>

<p>The <kc>INDOOR-area</kc> and the <kc>OUTDOOR-area</kc> are respectively equipped with a <ks>weightsensor</ks> and an <ks>outsonar</ks>. While being two physically different components, they serve the same logical function and thus they can be both modeled as <k>presence sensors</k> with appropriate <k>adapters</k>.</p>

<center><img src="./img/presence_actor.png" width="500px"></center>

<p>The sensor entity should be queryable as to know if it does or does not detect a presence. The actor using it (one for each sensor) should poll the presence within a fixed interval of time and fire an <k>event</k> each time the status changes from present to not-present (or the other way around). These actors thus present <k>proactive</k> behavior.</p>

<center><img src="./img/sonar_and_weight.png" width="500px"></center>

<h4>Thermometer and fan</h4>

<p>Much like the sonar and the weight sensor, the <ks>thermometer</ks> should be a queryable component encapsulated into a <k>proactive</k> actor that polls the temperature and fires an <k>event</k> with the new temperature value each time it varies <k>significantly</k>. Concerning the significance of a variation in temperature, it is worth noting that most general purpose sensors have a sensibility of <ks>0.1 °C</ks>.

<p>The <ks>fan</ks> should be a passive component able to start and stop the device when notified to do so. Its actor is <k>reactive</k> in nature and should be able to receive <k>dispatches</k> and update the status of the fan according to them.</p>

<center><img src="./img/thermometer_and_fan.png" width="500px"></center>

<h4>ParkServiceGUI and ParkServiceStatusGUI</h4>
<p>The ParkManagerService app is composed by two gui : ParkServiceGUI and ParkServiceStatusGUI.</p>
<p>We need to separate the two gui using two different actors because they cannot be on the same business logic node and because the customer's device will not be the same as the one the application is on.</p>
<center><img src="./img/gui_actor.png" width="500px"></center>

<p>The <k>ParkServiceGUI</k> has three buttons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first button needs to notify the interest in <ks>entering client auto</ks> in the parking-area and to receive as answer the number SLOTNUM of a free parking-slot (1<=SLOTNUM<=6). If the SLOTNUM is equal to zero, it means that no free slot is available.</li>
	<li>The second button (<ks>CARENTER</ks>) can be pressed only if SLOTNUM is greater than zero, so the transport trolley will take the car from the INDOOR to the assigned parking-slot. Then it will show to the customer a receipt that includes the (unique) <ks>TOKENID</ks> that will be needed when picking up the auto.</li>
	<li>The third button needs to <ks>pick up the car</ks> with the TOKENID received before and it must be written in the specific section, under the button. So the client’s car will be moved to the OUTDOOR-area.</li>
</ol>
<center><img src="./img/parkservicegui.png" width="500px"></center>

<p>The <k>ParkServiceStatusGUI</k> has a grid with the <ks>parking-area</ks> status (in which red rectangles are occupied parking-slots), a section with the <ks>transport trolley</ks> status (idle, working or stopped), a dedicated section to <ks>temperature</ks> of the parking-area, in which you can see and manage the <ks>fan</ks> status when it is necessary with the use of three buttons: <k>start</k>, <k>stop</k> or <k>auto</k> to automate the behavior of the fan. At last there is a rectangle in which alarms appear.</p>
<center><img src="./img/parkservicestatusgui.png" width="500px"></center>

<h4>The business logic</h4>

<p>The core business logic can be conveniently described as a finite-state machine to be enclosed into a proper actor. </p>
<center><img src="./img/business_logic.png" width="700px"></center>

<p>The <ks>goto</ks> outputs should be delivered to an entity able to perform the implied set of elementary actions on the trolley.</p>

<p>Regardless of the current state, the execution of the automaton must be <k>stopped</k> whenever the manager gives the relative signal. When the manager gives the resume signal, the automaton must resume its evolution from where it was interrupted.</p>

<p>In states <kc>acceptIN</kc> and <kc>acceptOut</kc>, if the conditions to process the relative requests are not met, their processing must be postponed. While the trolley is stopped, new enter and exit requests by clients are not postponed, they are instead refused (with proper notice).</p>

<p>The additional tasks <k>monitor</k> and <k>manage</k> must respectively update the <kc>ParkServiceStatusGUI</kc> with the current status of the system and accept the request by the manager to stop or resume the behavior of the trolley.</p>

<h4>Driving the trolley</h4>

<p>To access the <kc>WEnv</kc> (the virtual environment provided by the customer), it should be considered the usage of a more sophisticated tool, already available, called <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.kotlinSupports/userDocs/ActorWithKotlinSupport.html#IssWsHttpKotlinSupport">Basic Step Robot Actor</a>, which would be able to avoid interferences among overlapping commands and to natively receive movement orders expressed as steps. A new service, for now called <kc>RobotProxy</kc>, may be required to ensure compatibility between our system and the legacy tool <kc>Basic Step Robot Actor</kc>.</p>

<p>An already available singleton object called <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.planner20/userDocs/LabPlanner.html#plannerUtil">Planner Util</a> is able to plan the route to drive a robot to a specified spot avoiding obstacles, if provided with a map such as the one made available by the customer. This tool may be extended by a new component, which we will call <kc>Directional Planner</kc>, to add the functionality to plan the desired orientation of the robot alongside its desired position (so when the movement is complete, the trolley is also oriented toward the desired direction).</p>

<center><img src="./img/trolley_driving.png" width="500px"></center>

<p>The <kc>WEnv</kc> requires a <k>request-reply</k> communication paradigm. Even if some intermediate steps will probably favor different approaches, the replies from the <kc>WEnv</kc> should nevertheless be always brought back to the actor that originated the relative requests.</p>

<h4>The alarms</h4>

<p>The system requires the presence of a timed alarm for when the <kc>OUTDOOR-area</kc> has not been cleared within <ks>DTFREE</ks> time from the beginning of its occupation. The system also suggests the presence of a second alarm for when <ks>TA</ks> exceeds <ks>TMAX</ks> and some kind of notification for when <ks>TA</ks> goes back into its normal low temperature range.</p>

<p>We suggest the presence of two actors, one for the OUTDOOR and one for the temperature, that fire an <k>event</k> each time they have an alarm or a notification to report. For the actor requiring temporization, it is available a legacy component called <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.cautiousExplorer/userDocs/cautiousExplorerActors.html#project">TimerActor</a> that may be leveraged for this purpose.</p>
